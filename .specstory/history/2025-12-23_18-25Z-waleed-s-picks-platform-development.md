# Waleed's picks platform development (2025-12-23 18:25Z)

_**User (2025-12-23 18:25Z)**_

Today we will convert library of alexandrai from a finnicky sandbox., to a production grade platform. Here are what we will have:

my complete library, referred to as waleeds picks. The library will be page one. on page 2 we have pipeline. i will emphasize right now, that the procedure vie been using to get books for my kindle, will serve as the foundation for this prod grade tool. ive been using and iteratively improving the programs in this dir for about a year now. Here is the process i follow, and how that pipeline will be used by users. I paste a list of books  wa atuhors in scirpt 1. script 2 takes that list, normalizes if needed, adds free pdf online, and uses ddg api to open not just the serarch query, but it then ulls from script 33, which evaluates links, and selects the .pdf's to open. I then go thrpough the tabs, delete any broken or non fair use links, and then script 4, uses a macro to fgo to that window, ctrl S, enter, ctrl w, and saves all the books into a dir i specified. script 5 renames, them. no w users. I will be extremly hard pressed, if we cannot translate these scripts into being user facing. all it will take is 1. the books list, 2. opnening the windows and refining link selection,. 3. having them be able to choose links from our site on a dashboard in the pipeiline, or mamnually go choose waht they want, when they have it set, they select the crome window and on our platform they hit downlaod. rather than tell them navigate to it as it does the macros to download, we need a nelegant way for us to download them, and then show the useres all the files, we will ilkely have some blanck webpages, or fake sites we doewnloadk, but we can use an llm or logic to filter, giving the user less palces to fuck up the tool. my fear is at the stage where links are being opened, and then downlaofed, users may ghet lost and get their other chrom windows screwed, or click off mid macro run and aaccidentally save and delete other things, so we need elegance, but we have to show ppl tghe technical depth and use the simplified procvess at aclae to make it sophisticated. the final stage would be seleciton and approval, to ensure things are fair use, they slect books they want and then they sbumit for approval, whgich is usually <1 hour. at which point like the lib of alexandria in egypt, we ekep a copy, and give them a fair use copy. this gorws our platform. After this we have basic wishlist creation features, but utlimately its app, that we will also have an api for in case it gets taken down. its service based and data app, I need use to brainstorm the most elegant way to do this. ideaslly coding shoukld only be the final 10% of our work, bc we have a great foundation, alr almost every script, working ui, a foundation of books and more to use to experiment on importation as we enhance the platform. you cannot and will not fuck up planning. i want youre interpretation, and planning, and then i will give it to my consultant, if he approves we begin, you should root your reaosining in current state vs learning what the true desried state is, its the 2025 lightweight wikip[edia
